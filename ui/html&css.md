# HTML
- What is HTML
    -   Hypertext Markup Language
    -   HTML does not perform any logic for you
    -   You can not create web pages without using HTML
- What makes an HTML page an HTML page?
    - Elements
        - Elements are created via "tags" in your html page
        - Some tags include an opening and closing tag, others just a single tag 
                - common tags
                    - **div:** defines a “division” of your page
                    - **p:** defines a paragraph
                    - **span:** inline tag for grouping texts or elements
                    - **b:** bold text
                    - **i:** italicized text
                    - **h1, h2, ... h6:** headings
                    - **br:** line break
                    - **table:** defines a table
                    - **th:** table header(think column name)
                    - **tr:** table row (holds a row of data)
                    - **td:** table data (individual elements of a row)
                    - **img src="URL":** adds an image to your page
                    - **ol:** an ordered list (number bullets)
                        - **li:** list item
                    - **ul:** an unordered list (bullets)
                        - **li:** list item
                        - **a href="URL"**: makes a hyperlink
    - Attributes
        - Affect your elememnts
        - Attributes work very well with your styling
        - They follow a key:value pairing system
        - common attributes
            - **id:** a unique identifier for an element
            - **class:** a title given for a unique set of styling options
            - **src:** used with the img tag, you provide the link to your image with this attribute
            - **href:** used with the anchor tag, you provide a link to a new file or web page with this attribute

# The Box Model
- ALL Elements are inside their own box (unless you make it otherwise)
- ALL boxes have 4 parts to them
    - the content (innermost layer)
    - the padding
    - the border
    - the margin (outtermost layer)
- these for layers can all be affected by CSS styling

# CSS
- What is CSS?
    - Cascading Style Sheet
    - This provides information for your browser to understand how it should parse your elements
- What ways can you apply CSS styling?
    - Inline CSS
        - provided within the Element tag itself
    - Internal/Embedded CSS
        - provided within style tags within the header tags
        - it does the exact same thing for you that using inline CSS provides, but it applies your styling to all elements within a container, or all elements within a tag
    - External CSS
        - This provides the same functionality as internal and inline CSS, but the styling is provided from another source
- CSS has varying levels of priority
    - Inline CSS
    - ID selector
    - Class attribute and Psuedo-class attribute
    - Element and Pseudo-element selectors
- Common CSS Styling Options
    - **text-align** (aligns your text)
    - **color** (changes the color)
    - **position** (changes the position of the element)
    - **display** (changes elements to behave as inline or block elements)
        - inline elements go next to eachother
        - block elements go on top of eachother
    - **padding** (adjusts the padding of an element)
    - **border** (adjusts the border of an element)
        - border-style
            - none
            - hidden
            - dashed
            - solid
            - etc.
- Groupping CSS styling
    - Group selector
        - You can group tags together to give them the same styling options (p,h1{styling})
    - Child selector
        - child tags of the main container are given the styling options (div > p {styling})
    - sibling selectors
        - General sibiling
            - target elements that are after the selected element (div ~ p {styling})
                - this does not apply to any target elements that come before the selected element
                    - you can think of these "siblings" as the younger siblings specifically
        - Adjacent sibling
            - targets the element that is closest to the selected element (div + p {styling})
- Pseudo class and Pseudo element
    - Pseudo class styling options allow you to select the "state" of an element, not the element itself (p:hoover{styling})
    - Pseudo element allows for styling options that relate more to those things which are not tags (p::before {styling} and p::after {styling})
